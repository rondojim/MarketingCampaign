# Marketing Campaign 

## Purpose
<p align = "justify">
The purpose of this project is to get familiar with the basic stages of the process of implementing data mining techniques, namely: pre-processing /
cleaning, transformation, application of data mining techniques and evaluation.
The implementation will be done in Python programming language using the tools/libraries: jupyter notebook, pandas and SciKit Learn.

## Description
<p align = "justify">
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of ideal customers of a company.
It helps a company to better understand its customers and facilitates the modification of products according to specific needs,
behaviours and concerns of different types of customers.
</p>

## Tasks

#### Preprocessing / Cleaning
<p align = "justify">
Check if there are any missing values in the data and
handle them accordingly, convert columns relating to dates to DateTime
objects and check if there are attributes that you can encode/convert to numeric values.
Use information from already existing features in order to create new columns.  
and get clearer picture of the data using plots. 
</p>  

#### Correlation study
<p align = "justify">
Examine the correlation between features with a heatmap diagrams.
Use histograms and scatter plots to find the relationship between features.
Study the results and find useful information about the customers.
</p>

#### Principal component analysis (PCA)
<p align = "justify">
Reduce the dimensionality to three components while keeping as much of the original variation in the data as possible.
Visualize the 3D outcome.
</p>

#### Clustering
Use ELBOW method for determining the number of clusters to be formed.
Use clustering through cumulative clustering (K-means, Agglomerative)
Display the formed clusters via scatter plot.
